        <h1>Features</h1>
        <p>
            A <b>feature</b> is a set of blocks which can be activated and
            deactivated by an option. Each plugin can provide one feature.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each block has to be in a <em>category</em>. These have to have
            an <em>id</em> which identifies the category and is used to determine
            the localized name of the category. In addition they may have a
            <em>name</em> and a <em>color</em>. The latter is the color of all
            blocks assigned to this category.
